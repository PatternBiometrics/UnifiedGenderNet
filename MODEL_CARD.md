# UnifiedGenderNet â€“ Model Card

## Task
Binary gender prediction from **hand** or **face** images using a single model (UMCC or MAG).  

## Training data
- Derived from [HaGRID](https://github.com/hukenovs/hagrid) (HaGRID-Derived Faceâ€“Hand Pairs) (15,064 aligned faceâ€“hand pairs)
- Subject-exclusive splits (train/val/test)  
- Labels: **apparent gender**  

## Protocol
- Input: 224Ã—224 RGB  
- Optimizer: AdamW, cosine LR, batch 32  
- Loss: BCE (UMCC), BCE+modality CE (MAG)  
- Thresholds: 0.50 global, subgroup thresholds only for fairness  

## Results 
  - Details will be provided after paper publication

**Baseline (EffNetV2-S, UMCC, Full aug):**
- Test Accuracy â‰ˆ 91%  
- Balanced Accuracy â‰ˆ 91%  
- ROCâ€“AUC â‰ˆ 0.97  
- PRâ€“AUC â‰ˆ 0.97  

ðŸ“Œ Full results (ablations, fairness, cross-dataset) will be added post-publication

## Known limitations
- Lower stability on hands than faces  
- Cross-dataset drops (FairFace, 11K Hands)  
- Fairness disparities remain even after calibration ( more robuste approach is needed)
